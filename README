To build linpsk, untar the tar archiv and switch to the linpsk directory.
You need fftw and hamlib.

run:
mkdir -p build
cd build
qmake -o Makefile ../linpsk.pro
make
sudo make install


LinPSK now uses the alsa sound system.

You can use valid alsa devices like plughw:1 in the settings dialog
Also using the card name can be used. In this case LinPSK searches the cardnumber and opens
plughw:[cardnumber]

In case of problems you can define ( more complex ) devices in your .asoundrc file
