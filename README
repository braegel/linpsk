Important: This version uses qt5 !!!

To build linpsk, untar the tar archiv and switch to the linpsk directory.
You need fftw and hamlib.

run:
mkdir -p build
cd build
qmake -o Makefile ../linpsk.pro
make
sudo make install

This will install the binary into usr/local/bin and the desktop file into /usr/share/pixmaps/ and the icon file into /usr/share/pixmaps/ .

As LinPSK uses the alsa sound system, you can use valid alsa devices like plughw:1 in the settings dialog
Also using the card name can be usedi now. In this case LinPSK searches the cardnumber and opens
plughw:[cardnumber]

In case of problems you can define ( more complex ) devices in your .asoundrc file
